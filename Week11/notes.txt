Javascript is weird because of its flexibility. However, languages tend to last because of their flexibility. 

*Mocha, LiveScript, ECMAScript, Javascript -> alternative names

Originally called Mocha. Java was obscenely popular in the 90s and everyone jumped on the coffee bandwagon, therefore, Mocha for Javascript.

Java and Javascript - "cousins so distantly related they could get married in any state of the union"

ECMAScript is a standard that Java adheres to. 

Javascript is asynchronous. A command can run to completion while multiple other commands are runinng.
Javascript is worked on by an assortion of companies; it is not owned by a single company.

Apparently, Netscape was the browser that decided to have multiple tabs instead of multiple web pages. 
Microsoft vs. Netscape. Microsoft bankrupted Netscape, but got hit by huge fines due to a mononpoly. Netscape created the Mozilla project from which Firefox was born. 
Netscape had enough connections that they were able to get Microsoft to realize that they couldn't monopolize the field. 

In the end of the 90s, early 2000s, you would have to hire a company with a backend and a frontend team to develop a website. 

Javascript is a dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based language.

Prototyped based inheritance is inheritance that inherits from an object and not a class; it's more stripped down, less rigid. Sort of OO light.

3 ways to create a variable:
*const - never change
*let - local in scope
*var - global in scope (generally, do not use this anymore!!!)

Javascript objects are hash maps. A key can associate to any type of data. A key can be an object, a function, or any data you want.

In JavaScript, there are no less than 5 ways to create an object. 

1. Object literal - create a hashmap (variableName: variableValue)
2. Factory Functions - returns a hashmap
3. Constructor Function - new keyword (synctactic sugar)
